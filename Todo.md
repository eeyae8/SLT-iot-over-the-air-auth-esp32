## Amandi's inner thoughts, noted down. Not very neat sorry :\

-Check how to do with 4G module
    - Depends on the model but we require a GSM library (e.g TinyGSM). Need specific model first

-Maybe make a html page for input wifi? how to make secure? 
    - Github has a root certificate that you can paste into the main.cpp file or better, save as SPIFF
    - Pros: secure comms
    - Cons: uses more memory on esp32

-Edit so asks user using something in the place of a 'button push' whether to update to new firmware or not. DONE
